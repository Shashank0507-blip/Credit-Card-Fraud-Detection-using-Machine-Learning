**Project Overview:**

_This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using lightgbm, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. It includes:_
Data preprocessing & feature engineering,
Model training and evaluation,
Saving the trained model for real-world predictions,
User-friendly input handling for new transactions.

   1. If any missing values are found, we either impute them or remove them.
      Since we collect user inputs, we replace missing values (with suitable estimates.

   2. The dataset contains Time, Amount, and 28 PCA-transformed features (V1-V28).
      Feature Scaling: Since transaction amounts vary widely, we use MinMaxScaler to bring all values into a standard range (0 to 1) to ensure fair model performance.
   
Fraudulent transactions are rare (~0.17% of total data).
We check for extreme outliers that might skew the model.

_Once the data is preprocessed, we train an "LIGHTGBM" Classifier to detect fraud. Hereâ€™s the process that was used:_

   1._Train-Test Split:_
     The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) to evaluate performance.

   2._Model Selection:_
     We use lightgbm, which is an optimized gradient boosting technique.

   3._Hyperparameter Tuning:_
     We apply "Bayesian Search" to find the best hyperparameters like:
     learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators, colsample_bytree and subsample.
