## **Results Obtained by training and testing the model:**

### **Without using the feature selection process:**

* Model Accuracy : 0.9983
* Model Precision : 0.5000
* Model Recall : 0.8878
* Model F1 Score : 0.6397

### **Using the feature selection process:**
A combination of mutual information and recursive feature elimination were used in the process of feature selection in this scenario.
the output of mutual information which gave us the information on how each feature was affecting the output , and we used this information to select the top contributing features and gave it to recursive feature elimination(RFE) as an input.
However this provided comparatively results of lower value, as a lot of features were removed. So we decided to include every feature to train and test the data.

### **These are the following values obtained while using the feature selection process:**

* Model Accuracy : 0.9938
* Model Precision : 0.2042
* Model Recall : 0.8980
* Model F1 Score : 0.3327
